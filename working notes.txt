// ok what is the next thing that i need to do?
I need to distill to these tables:
* Existing:
	route, direction, etc.
	calendar stuff
OK, here is the plan -- try to use the dense_rank() function to generate identifiers for all of this below
- we can either:
	- import all of this and then normalize
	- work backwards to pull out separate queries that result in separate, normalized data tables
* Pattern
* Pattern_order // shit, i need to figure out how to deal with timed patterns and patterns separately
* Pattern_timed
* Pattern_stop_time
* Schedule
